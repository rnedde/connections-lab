    Connections Lab Fall 2024
    Week 1 Assignment:
  - Your landing page should portray your interpretation of the prompt and should explain it to a user. For example, if your prompt is “a website about musical lamps for singers”, your site should contain the design, a promotion about musical lamps, maybe a button to “Learn More” (the button doesn’t have to go anywhere), and speak to the audience of “singers”. 
Note, you’re also welcome to mix up the prompts, e.g., mix prompts *“A website about musical lamps for singers”* and *“A website that offers life-saving advice for smurfs”* and it becomes *“A website about musical lamps for smurfs”.*
- Your website should also include at least 1 CSS animation (e.g. an object should move to a different position on the page over time). Animation should be in line with your interpretation of the prompt. See the BONUS section for CSS animation references.
- Upload your project files to your own Github repo and post the link on the Notion [Weekly Homework page](https://www.notion.so/Weekly-Homework-78f9c29962ca4285803029da311dcac2?pvs=21) **by Tuesday, September 10th 12pm (noon) ET.**
- Your folder should contain an .html file, a .css file and any media assets (i.e. images) needed to properly load your webpage. Please also include pictures of your wireframes.
